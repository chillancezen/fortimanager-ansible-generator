# ansible-fortimanager-generic

### What's the generic module?

The generic module is to fill the gap which exists between FortiManager features being published and Ansible modules reflecting those features.

### Setup the environment 
make sure you have `ansible>=2.8.0` installed with python2 or python3. run the `setup.py` to copy the generic module to ansible module directory.

```sh
$python3 setup.py 
$python2 setup.py # if you are using python2
```
