 -  it's optional to format the generated modules to pep8 compatible.

### 3. before running test manually, make sure the hosts inventory is correct
 ```
#cd tests_collection
#ansible-playbook -i hosts/ -vvv script_set.yml
```
note some test cases playbook are outdated, upon errors, please refer to the generated document fox a fix.

### 4.  docs generated by Sphinx.
all the generated docs are under `ReadTheDocs`.

for now, __better clone the directory to display locally in your browser__. 

we have problems in [`readthedocs.io`](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/6460) and [`github.io`](https://chillancezen.github.io/) .  but eventually they will go to readthedocs.io
